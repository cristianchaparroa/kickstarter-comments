I would like to have your address, phone number and email address.
by your actions and keeping your backers in the dark for a year and half I had no other choice but to feel that us backers had been scammed. I personally feel its been long enough already.
so if this going to take another year? keep your backers in the loop. Taking our money and never hearing from you is a very asshole thing to do. welcome to the grown world.",1451947668,UHJvamVjdENvbW1lbnQtMTIxNzA1MDE=

This past year and a half has been very hard on me.  I relocated to take care of my grandfather who was battling cancer and passed away.  I have been very depressed and struggling for awhile now.  I cared for my Nana for the last three years of her life and loved her very much.  I'm embarrassed and sad that the book is not published yet.  This is my first book and I'm unsure of the whole process.  How many books have you published?  I never intended to ""scam"" people out of money.

There are only 88 tokens in the set. Due to layout changes we dropped a sheet of tokens that brought them to 88 instead of 96. So do not fear you are not missing anything. It appears their is a misprint on some of the double sided plane tokens (red/green).

The back of the box lists what should be inside, unfortunetly each box had (11) cardboard sheets of 8-pouch tokens for (88) total tokens instead of the 96 listed on the box and on KS project page.  In both boxes I received boards #1 to #8, plus board #9B and #10F.  One box had board #11F and in the other had board #11B.  My guess is that each box should have both #11B & #11F.

The other listed items are present:  (1) Rule Booklet; (4) six-sided approx. 7/16"" dice; (25) Card Events, and (5) Aircraft Carriers in five-card sets double sided (Set #9=Akagi; Set #10= USS Enterprise; Set #11=USS Yorktown; Set #12=USS Hornet; Set #13=Shinano).",1432672692,UHJvamVjdENvbW1lbnQtOTk3MjI5NQ==

You tricked GOG users with DLC. There is nothing to discuss here. You think that GOG users are second-class people. You think that you can to not fulfill your promises and still have an awesome shiny face and a brilliant reputation. This is not true.

No one likes deceivers and scammers. You have a choice now: to fulfill a promise and regain your reputation or continue to reject the claims of players who just want to get what they paid for: a DRM-Free game with all DLC. Just stop fantasizing and inventing fables.

You want to use YOUR OWN DRM service for online gaming, but don't want to use a GOG platform - and this is YOUR OWN CHOICE. But other online games developers don't have such problem and these excuses are not like the truth.

WHY DECEIVE PEOPLE IF YOU WEREN'T ORIGINALLY GOING TO MAKE THIS GAME DRM-FREE? I just want to get my refund and I think I'm not alone with this wish.

BoboMcGraw, Ruinaes and Fong Lam, I've just looked into your missing keys and resent them to you via email, from me Blake. Just check your inboxes and you should be good now, if you have any questions get back to me directly via email and I'll sort you out :)

Ruinaes to get back to your question about Update#45's Plan we have stuck to it, with only the recent exception of releasing the Bandits after a much too long delay separately to the iPad release. The iPad release was simply holding everything up too much which we explain in our most recent updates - to give you an update on the iPad release it is coming, we are actively working hard on it now and making great progress.

I saw another question about the Art Book, it's almost done!! I even saw a pre-release draft this morning and it looks glorious - really we have gone way beyond and its far better than anyone will expect. We're just going through final proofing, lithographing etc...

Regarding the Novellas... they're written!! Yes they're all done, we're just queuing up the task of getting them prepared for distribution which is a task in itself. At this stage we're planning on releasing them around the same time as the iPad release of Armello.

There's a little bit more in our recent update here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/leagueofgeeks/armello-bringing-tabletop-adventures-to-life/posts/1870041

Yes, you are correct. We have not decided on colors for the limited edition Cella yet, but will update all our backers once we do. There's roughly 150-170 Cella in that indoor garden photo. For one square meter of garden, you need about 250 mixed sizes of Cella.

In the video, we used strong adhesive tape to attach the Cella to the wall. We recommend that you use a stronger adhesive, however, if you wish to create a permanent fixture on the wall.

Don't be afraid to tune the difficulty to your liking and then make it harder later once you have some wins under your belt.  If enemies are a particular problem but you want the same overall difficulty, use one less enemy and 4 more hazards.  I would definitely suggest starting with at least 3 survivors, the 2 survivor variant is balanced mathematically, but requires you to worry a lot more about positioning and timing.  Also make sure that you're not using the Elite enemy tiles.  Again, they are balanced, but can require strategies that you may not have picked up yet.",1467830086,UHJvamVjdENvbW1lbnQtMTM4MzQyNzc=

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/827919495/adrians-model-airplane-kit-cutting-project,"Yes! There are parts and plans all over the place. I'm in full production mode. I got my vac forming machine cleaned up and working. It was a bit decrepit after sitting idle for over 10 years. I made a new mold for the R2 cowl over the weekend. It's huge! I don't remember it seeming so big. I am having to correct each cutting file as I go as they have ""anomalies"" from being translated from my Windows 95 software to my Windows 7 laser cutter software. Nothing major... just a lot of files. 

I am also slowly figuring out an efficient work flow. I tried making a jig for the laser table to cut 6 sheets at once but it was a pain. Now I'm cutting 1 sheet at a time and it seems a lot easier. I just can't do anything else while I'm cutting as I have change sheets every 3 minutes or so.

1700 square feet of plans showed up yesterday. This all a bit more overwhelming than I anticipated. I'm treating it as one would treat eating an elephant... one bite at a time. It won't be too much longer.

I'm not sure if I can post pictures to this comment page. I'll see if I can figure it out.

We're bringing in copies of the game directly from Gen X to send out to you guys (and adding in the Koto promo card), so the turnaround for this project shouldn't be too long. It's when the games need to be produced that we often have to take a long time. When it's something like Seven Swords though, it's a much simpler process.

@Kristian - thank you as always. We're delighted that we've got you on board for this one :D Hope you enjoy the game when it lands!

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gamesalute/seven-swords,"@Andrew, I pledged to 5 games of Game Salute last year, and I'll say that for a long while I was very vocally frustrated with the company, not just because of tardiness but mainly due to the lack of informative communication.  I spoke at length with both Michael and Game Salute' s owner/president Dan Yarrington and I'm happy to say that communication has improved tremendously across all of the projects of their's I've backed.  I'm much more confident now in coming back to support more of their projects.

The one thing I question is the skateboard truck construction on the Traveler. It seems to be mostly cosmetic in design and doesn't function similar to an actual skateboard truck (I was hoping it would). The bushings/kingpin serves no function to aid in turning or shock absorption. Even if the bushings/kingpin were functional, the wheels don't have much clearance. Essentially,  you have a carry on bag with a reinforced axle and better wheels. All in all, not a bad thing, but it's kind of a waste of material if it doesn't serve a purpose other than aesthetics to ""look like"" a skateboard truck.

Hello Robert, 
Thanks for asking and sorry for making confusion.

The one you will be getting soon is the theme about ""Space"" which is my original project. I was planning to continue this project for other topics as well, by making series. As many people were asking about other series as well, I wanted to ask more people's opinion.

**********
In regards to the bikers they ended up completely coming out of my pocket so they have been delayed until I can fund casting them myself. Which will happen but it may be a while as I'm not exactly lucrative yet :) the tank is even finished but like the bikes will be financed by me when cast and the tank will be even costlier due to its size. I promise I will keep you up to date though as it progresses however slowly.
**********

That message was received on February 22nd of this year, and honestly, I'd forgotten about this particular project.  Not that I'm not interested in getting the minis, just it's been so long since an update, it hasn't crossed my mind.

I know money's tight, but John, is there any way we could get an update of some kind?  I notice that the Trench website is not functional anymore.  I really liked the dwarves I received, and I'm sure lots of other people did as well.  Are you selling them anywhere now to try and raise some capital?

Just curious as to what's going on when you've got some time.

But I am a liitle bit confused.

Please take a look at the pic

I pledged 83 $ for 
one full platoon = 10 Figures + extra figure + Free engineer
command Group (5 Figures -> Officer, Standard bearer, com link, engíneer, trooper)
5 Bikers.

On the pic you can see what you sent me.

I think there is an comlink trooper and an officer from the command Group missing.
And I think the additional flamer is wrong

I know that I have to wait for the bikes

Hi Uwe,

The bikers have been a very slow slog due to the fact the funds just didnt cover the completion if the full unit ( 3-4 poses) so they are being covered by my own expenses so there are not expected until I finish everyone there basic order. Then the dwarfs will go up for general sale to the public and then the bike hopefully will be completed. It's tough when your small company like me but rest assured they will be out in the near future!
